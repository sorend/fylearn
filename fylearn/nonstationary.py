r"""Implementation of non-stationary fuzzy sets [1]

A nonstationary fuzzy set can be described as a fuzzy set which changes
its parameters with a timestamp t.

$A = \int_{t \in T} \int_{x \in X} \mu_A(t, x)/x/t$

For a function having $m$ parameters, $p \in \{1, \dots, m\}$, we can think of its definition as

$\mu_A(t, x) = \mu_A(x, p_1(t), \dots, p_m(t))$

We allow the parameters to vary around the actual membership function, based on the timestamp $t$.
The basic idea is to allow minor variations in the membership function, not to allow it to change
drastically, which is up to the pertubation function.

For each call to the membership function, $t$ will be increased (think of it as seconds).
